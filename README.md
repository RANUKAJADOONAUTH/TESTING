# Rising Tides of Deception: Financial Fraud in Guyana‚Äôs Oil & Gas Economy

# Introduction
Guyana discovered significant oil reserves off its coast in 2015. Production began in 2019, particularly in the colossal Stabroek Block under a consortium led by ExxonMobil, along with Hess and China‚Äôs CNOOC. Oil revenues have since become a major component of Guyana‚Äôs economy.
While oil can fuel development‚Äîbuilding infrastructure, improving public services, reducing poverty‚Äîthere is strong risk that fraud, corruption, and mismanagement will undermine those benefits. Without robust oversight, the very lucrativeness of oil projects can incentivize illicit or semi‚Äëlicit behavior (e.g. misreporting, cost inflation, undue political influence, non‚Äëtransparent contracting).
This project examines what kinds of financial fraud are increasing in Guyana‚Äôs oil & gas sector, with case studies; identifies systemic vulnerabilities; evaluates existing legal and institutional frameworks; and proposes measures to reduce fraud and increase accountability.
Types of Financial Fraud / Malpractice in Guyana Oil & Gas

# Common Types of Financial Fraud in Guyana's Oil Sector
1. Cost Recovery Abuse - Oil companies inflate their expenses to reduce how much profit Guyana gets.
2. Lack of Financial Transparency - Companies don't clearly report how much money they make or owe to Guyana.
3. Corrupt Licensing Practices - Oil licenses are awarded unfairly, often to friends or political allies.
4. Political Elite Capture - Powerful individuals benefit more from oil deals than the general public.
5. Fake Training and Services - Fraudsters offer fake courses or services related to the oil sector.

# Content & Explaination
- - Generally speaking, credit score cards are based on historical data. Once encountering large economic fluctuations. Past models may lose their original predictive power. Logistic model is a common method for credit scoring. Because Logistic is suitable for binary classification tasks and can calculate the coefficients of each feature. In order to facilitate understanding and operation, the score card will multiply the logistic regression coefficient by a certain value (such as 100) and round it.
- At present, with the development of machine learning algorithms. More predictive methods such as Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines have been introduced into credit card scoring. However, these methods often do not have good transparency. It may be difficult to provide customers and regulators with a reason for rejection or acceptance.
