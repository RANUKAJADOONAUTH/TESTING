# Rising Tides of Deception: Financial Fraud in Guyana‚Äôs Oil & Gas Economy

# Introduction
Guyana discovered significant oil reserves off its coast in 2015. Production began in 2019, particularly in the colossal Stabroek Block under a consortium led by ExxonMobil, along with Hess and China‚Äôs CNOOC. Oil revenues have since become a major component of Guyana‚Äôs economy.
While oil can fuel development‚Äîbuilding infrastructure, improving public services, reducing poverty‚Äîthere is strong risk that fraud, corruption, and mismanagement will undermine those benefits. Without robust oversight, the very lucrativeness of oil projects can incentivize illicit or semi‚Äëlicit behavior (e.g. misreporting, cost inflation, undue political influence, non‚Äëtransparent contracting).
This project examines what kinds of financial fraud are increasing in Guyana‚Äôs oil & gas sector, with case studies; identifies systemic vulnerabilities; evaluates existing legal and institutional frameworks; and proposes measures to reduce fraud and increase accountability.
Types of Financial Fraud / Malpractice in Guyana Oil & Gas

# Common Types of Financial Fraud in Guyana's Oil Sector
1. Cost Recovery Abuse - Oil companies inflate their expenses to reduce how much profit Guyana gets.
2. Lack of Financial Transparency - Companies don't clearly report how much money they make or owe to Guyana.
3. Corrupt Licensing Practices - Oil licenses are awarded unfairly, often to friends or political allies.
4. Political Elite Capture - Powerful individuals benefit more from oil deals than the general public.
5. Fake Training and Services - Fraudsters offer fake courses or services related to the oil sector.

# Evidence That Fraud is Growing
Reports from government agencies and the media show that fraud cases are increasing quickly.In 2023, the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) reported that suspicious financial transactions increased from 107 in 2022 to 180 in 2023.The value of these suspicious transactions rose from GY$1.96 billion to GY$153.3 billion, a massive jump.Disputes between the government and oil companies about ‚Äúcost recovery‚Äù are becoming more common. One audit found that ExxonMobil may have overcharged Guyana by over US$214 million.

## üìä Sample Data (Suspicious Transaction Reports)

| Year | Suspicious Transactions | Value (GY$)     |
|------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| 2022 | 107                      | 1.96 Billion    |
| 2023 | 180                      | 153.3 Billion   |

# Why is Fraud Increasing
1. Weak Laws and Oversight
Many of the laws and rules that govern oil operations are outdated or too weak. Agencies often don‚Äôt have enough staff or training to catch complex fraud.
